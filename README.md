# Lingua Player
Lingua Player is an advanced media player with all features of well-known apps such as MX player but with an outstanding advantage; it has unique features to build vocabulary, improve your speaking and listening just by watching your favorite movies.

Subtitle translation feature:

Do not be afraid of watching foreign movies with native subtitles anymore. Whenever you didn't know the meaning of a word, phrase, or even the whole sentence you can just move your finger on the subtitle, and google translate will translate it for you. With the help of google translate, we can translate from any language to any other language.

Speak fluently with the shadowing feature:

Lingua player's shadowing mode automatically skips the silent parts of the movie and just loops over the conversations.
Listen to each conversation multiple times then try to repeat it with the same accent and intonation you just heard. Lingua Player records your voice so you can compare it with the movie and detect your flaws and improve it.
This way you can memorize real-world sentences, improve your accent and prepare for the TOEFL and IELTS speaking sections.

Improve listening comprehension with the smart subtitle:

You might have noticed that whenever you add a subtitle you just read the subtitles instead of listening. Smart subtitle solves this problem by displaying each sentence after the actor or actress has finished his or her sentence instead of displaying it simultaneously.
By enabling this feature, at first, you listen to the movie and try to comprehend it. In the next step, you see the transcription of that voice and now you can how much The smart subtitle is an effortless method to improve your listening skills just by watching movies.
